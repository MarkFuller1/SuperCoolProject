# SuperCoolProject

Guys im having second thoughts, this might not be as cool as I thought.

9. What happened? Why?
 - An error occurred when I ran the command "git checkout main" because the changes would be overwritten by the checkout, so in order to not get the error, I have to commit the changes.

10. How are these commands different?
 - "git add filename" adds only the file w/ the name specified
 - "git add *" adds all files that don't start with a dot
 - "git add ." adds all files
 
 12. Did it work? Why? Where did your changes go?
